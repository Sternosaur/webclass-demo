  <p>Hi, my name is <span style="font-size:50px"><span class="blue-text">Randall</span><span style="font-size:16px">, but most know me by my online handle <span style="font-size:50px"><span class="red-text">Sternosaur</span><span style="font-size:16px">.</p>
  <p>I've been playing video games since I was 5, but was always told by my parents that<br>
  it was a waste of my time and that I should get a real job. That wasn't really for me,<br>
  so I joined the army instead. After 2 deployments to Afghanistan that was enough for me<br>
  to become motivated enough to start figuring out what I wanted out of life. I moved to<br>
  to Arizona to catch up with some family who moved out from Chicago years ago where I grew.<br><br>
  I figured if I had to get a degree in anything, I wanted it to be game related since that<br>
  was my biggest passion. Unfortunately there weren't any great game design colleges in<br>
  Phoenix, so I ended up moving back to Chicago to persue a degree in game design.<br>
  Now I'm finally here for my last semester. I have decided to make a lot of drastic<br>
  changes to my life this year. I got married, lost 50 pounds, got a house, and now I'm<br>
  learning how to make a website and starting to build out a live streaming/gaming setup<br>
  in my basement.<br><br>
  I don't want to make it sound like game design is just a plan B for me<br>
  or something, but I feel like I owe it to myself to at least try to create a set schedule<br>
  for streaming and making videos between Twitch and YouTube and give it the college try to<br>
  follow my dreams for a couple of years. I've got a lot going on right now though between<br>
  full time college and work, but I'm at least getting some footage recording some fun<br>
  sessions with my friends in the meantime. I'd rather try for a couple of years and fail<br>
  then to never give it a try and always wonder what if.</p>
  <br>
  <p style ="font-size: 200%;">Wish me luck!</p>
