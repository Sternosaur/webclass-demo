  <p>Hi, my name is <span class="blue-text">Randall</span>, but most know me by my online handle <span class="red-text">Sternosaur</span>.</p>
  <p>I've been playing video games since I was 5, but was always told by my parents that</p>
  <p>it was a waste of my time and that I should get a real job. That wasn't really for me,</p>
  <p>so I joined the army instead. After 2 deployments to Afghanistan that was enough for me</p>
  <p>to become motivated enough to start figuring out what I wanted out of life. I moved to</p>
  <p>to Arizona to catch up with some family who moved out from Chicago years ago where I grew.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>I figured if I had to get a degree in anything, I wanted it to be game related since that</p>
  <p>was my biggest passion. Unfortunately there weren't any great game design colleges in</p>
  <p>Phoenix, so I ended up moving back to Chicago to persue a degree in game design.</p>
  <p>Now I'm finally here for my last semester. I have decided to make a lot of drastic</p>
  <p>changes to my life this year. I got married, lost 50 pounds, got a house, and now I'm</p>
  <p>learning how to make a website and starting to build out a live streaming/gaming setup</p>
  <p>in my basement.</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>I don't want to make it sound like game design is just a plan B for me</p>
  <p>or something, but I feel like I owe it to myself to at least try to create a set schedule</p>
  <p>for streaming and making videos between Twitch and YouTube and give it the college try to</p>
  <p>follow my dreams for a couple of years. I've got a lot going on right now though between</p>
  <p>full time college and work, but I'm at least getting some footage recording some fun</p>
  <p>sessions with my friends in the meantime. I'd rather try for a couple of years and fail</p>
  <p>then to never give it a try and always wonder what if. Wish me luck!</p>
